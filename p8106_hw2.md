``` r
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(caTools) # split data
library(caret)
# library(tidymodels)
# library(plotmo)
# library(kknn)
# library(FNN)

```

``` r
# read csv files 
df = read_csv("./College.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

# partition (training:test=80:20)
set.seed(100)
sample = sample.split(df$college, SplitRatio = .80)
train = subset(df, sample == TRUE)
test = subset(df, sample == FALSE)
```

The college data is split into train (80%) and test (20%).
